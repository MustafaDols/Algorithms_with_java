# Algorithms_with_java
Algorithms in Java solve problems efficiently. Key types:  Sorting – (e.g., QuickSort, Bubble Sort). Searching – (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search). Recursion – (e.g., Factorial, Fibonacci). Graph Algorithms – (e.g., BFS, DFS). Dynamic Programming – (e.g., Knapsack, Fibonacci).
